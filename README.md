# Executive-Dashboard-Bike stores

A portfolio project looking at a financial dataset and creating my first interactive dashboard.

This is another project that was done through processing data through Excel and Microsoft SQL. Later using Tableau to display the visualisation of the data.

Ask: Questions to Analyse:

- Are there any insights or trends in the sales volumes over time?
- What are the revenues per region, store, and brand?

Prepare: 
- Data was downloaded from Kaggle.com as 9 different CVC files
- Data was looked at with Excel but no cleaning or wrangling was needed
- Data was then imported into Microsoft SQL Server

Process: 
- Data was processed using Microsoft SQL Server (please refer to script)
- Important and relevant data was extracted from the 9 different tables by using JOINS

Analyse/Share: Finally, an interactive visualisation dashboard was made using Tableau.

ACT:

Some noticeable trends (many more can obviously be made, but for the sake of time I have only listed 3): 
- Motorbikes are becoming increasingly more popular to buy as every year a higher percentage sell
- March to June see the highest amounts of sale. This could be due to the incoming summer months and the deals/promotions running during this time.
- Baldwain Bikes consistently sells the most bikes with over 60% every year
Revenues per region:
- New Yoke is the most profitable region while Texas is the least
Revenues per store:
- Baldwain Bikes makes the most revenue
Revenues per brand:
- Trek makes the most revenue
